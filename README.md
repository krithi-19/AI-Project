# AI-Project
The project initially aimed to identify prediabetes in a group of 16 participants using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. However, due to challenges in directly predicting prediabetes, the focus shifted towards exploring classification algorithms. The dataset combined CGM data with demographic information like age, gender, and HbA1c levels. After addressing missing data and creating new features (feature engineering), we employed three algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees. These algorithms aimed to classify blood sugar levels into high, low, or normal based on both glucose data and demographics. While directly predicting prediabetes wasn't achieved initially, the project provides valuable insights into the potential of wearable sensors and AI for monitoring and classifying blood sugar levels.
